Palfy-Saxl Problem
==================
This repsitory contains notes and articles related to a problem of Palfy and Saxl.  

**Problem.**
Let A be a finite algebra with Con(A) isomorphic to M_n, for some n at least 4. 
If three nontrivial congruences of A pairwise permute, does it follow
that every pair of congruences of A permute?
