<b>Title:</b> On a problem of Palfy and Saxl about permutability in diamonds.
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
Among the oldest open questions in universal algebra is the following: Which finite lattices are congruence lattices of finite algebras? We consider a related problem about a special class of lattice, namely, the "diamonds" M<sub><i>n</i></sub>, which are height-two modular lattice with <i>n</i> atoms. In 1990, Peter Palfy and Jan Saxl used deep results from group theory to show that if a finite algebra has a congruence lattice isomorphic to M<sub><i>n</i></sub> with <i>n>3</i>, and if at least three of the nontrivial congruences pairwise permute, then <i>n</i> - 1 is a power of a prime. In doing so, they also proved that if a <i>G</i>-set has M<sub><i>n</i></sub> (<i>n</i> > 3) as a congruence lattice and at least 3 atoms pairwise permute, then all congruences permute.

Palfy and Saxl leave open the following question: if a finite algebra has congruence lattice M<sub><i>n</i></sub> for some <i>n</i> > 3, and if at least 3 atoms pairwise permute, does it follow that all congruences permute?

In this talk, we present some background required to understand the question, and then cover a little bit of tame congruence theory that helps dispense with the "easy" (weakly abelian) case of the problem. We then discuss some alternative strategies that we hope may lead to a solution in the harder (strongly abelian) case.
